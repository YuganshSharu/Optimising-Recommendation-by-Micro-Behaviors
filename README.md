E-commerce websites are famous for their wide range of products, but sometimes, it can be difficult for shoppers to locate relevant information, even with user-generated content. Basic ranking methods such as price, rating, and relevance can only do so much in creating a personalized shopping experience. To address this issue, a more individualized system could be introduced, considering various factors, including the user's recent browsing and shopping history, the product's characteristics, user interaction with the product page, and micro and macro behaviors.

In this project, we use these micro behaviors with traditional content-based filtering algorithms to create a recommendation system that can create better recommendations for users. The recommendations based on these micro behaviors are far more useful and can provide immense business advantages for e-commerce players.
